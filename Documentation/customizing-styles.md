Customizing Styles
==================

You have two options when customizing styles:

1. The easiest way is to override the `Themes\MyTheme\Views\Shared\_Head.cshtml` and decide yourself what CSS you want to include. With this approach you will need to take care of concatenation and minification of the CSS yourself.
2. Start a new theme as instructed in [Getting Started With a New Theme](getting-started-with-a-new-theme.md) and follow the rest of the instructions in this document. Doing it this way Atomia Store will take care of bundling and minification automatically.

When you start a new theme the stylesheet `Themes\MyTheme\content\css\theme.css` is generated by default, and registered with the default `StyleBundle`.

This stylesheet can be used to override styles from the Default theme style sheet.

If you want to do more than just override the Default styles, you can customize what `StyleBundles` are registered in `App_Start\BundleConfig`.


Adding a Stylesheet to the Default Bundle
-----------------------------------------

The Default `StyleBundle` virtual path can be retrieved by using `Atomia.Store.Themes.Default.BundleConfig.DEFAULT_STYLES_BUNDLE`.
 
This is how the generated `theme.css` is added, and can be done like this:

    var styleBundle = bundles.GetBundleFor(Atomia.Store.Themes.Default.BundleConfig.DEFAULT_STYLES_BUNDLE);
    styleBundle.Include("~/Themes/MyTheme/Content/css/theme.css");


Completely Replacing the Default Bundle Styles
----------------------------------------------

If you want to completely customize the styles, you might do something like this:
    
    var styleBundle = new StyleBundle("~/Themes/MyTheme/Content/css");
    styleBundle.Include("~/Themes/MyTheme/Content/css/theme.css");
    
    bundles.Clear();
    bundles.Add(styleBundle);


You then need to override the `Themes\MyTheme\Views\Shared\_Head.cshtml` view partial to use the bundle you registered instead of the default one:

    ...
    @Styles.Render("~/Themes/MyTheme/Content/css")
    ..
